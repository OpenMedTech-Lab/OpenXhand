# <P align="center"> OpenXhand - Open Source Hand Exoskeleton 

### OBJECTIVES:
The objective of this project was to develop a compact and lightweight rehabilitative exoskeleton to restore grasping functions for people with hand paralysis.

### DESCRIPTION:
<P align="justify">Millions of individuals suffer from upper extremity paralysis caused by neurological disorders including stroke, traumatic brain injury, or spinal cord injury. Robotic hand exoskeletons can substitute the missing motor control and help restore the functions in daily operations. However, most of the hand exoskeletons are bulky, stationary, and cumbersome to use. We have modified a recent existing design (Tenoexo) to prototype a motorized, lightweight, fully wearable rehabilitative hand exoskeleton by combining rigid parts with a soft mechanism capable of producing various grasps needed for the execution of daily tasks. Mechanical evaluation of our exoskeleton showed that it can produce fingertip force up to 8 N and can cover 91.5Â° of range of motion in just 3 s. We further tested the performance of the developed robotic exoskeleton in two quadriplegics with chronic hand paralysis and observed immediate success on independent grasping of different daily objects. The results suggested that our exoskeleton is a viable option for hand function assistance, allowing patients to regain lost finger control for everyday activities.

### DISCLAIMER:
<P align="justify"> The design is offered as it is. Although it has been regorously tested with utmost care and to the best of our knowledge, we do not provide any warranty in any aspect.

### WARNING:
- The device is intended stricktly for research and education purposes.
- The exoskeleton is not certified for use without receving prior approval from a local safety board or review committee.
