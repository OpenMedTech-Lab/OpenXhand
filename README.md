# Hand-Exoskeleton
A Compact and Lightweight Rehabilitative Exoskeleton to Restore Grasping Functions for People with Hand Paralysis
# Abstract 
Millions of individuals suffer from upper extremity paralysis caused by neurological disorders including stroke, traumatic brain injury, or spinal cord injury. Robotic hand exoskeletons can substitute the missing motor control and help restore the functions in daily operations. However, most of the hand exoskeletons are bulky, stationary, and cumbersome to use. We have modified a recent existing design (Tenoexo) to prototype a motorized, lightweight, fully wearable rehabilitative hand exoskeleton by combining rigid parts with a soft mechanism capable of producing various grasps needed for the execution of daily tasks. Mechanical evaluation of our exoskeleton showed that it can produce fingertip force up to 8 N and can cover 91.5Â° of range of motion in just 3 s. We further tested the performance of the developed robotic exoskeleton in two quadriplegics with chronic hand paralysis and observed immediate success on independent grasping of different daily objects. The results suggested that our exoskeleton is a viable option for hand function assistance, allowing patients to regain lost finger control for everyday activities.
