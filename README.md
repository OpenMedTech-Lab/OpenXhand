# <P align="center"> OpenXhand - Open Source Hand Exoskeleton 

### OBJECTIVES:
The objective of this project was to develop a compact and lightweight rehabilitative exoskeleton to restore grasping functions for people with hand paralysis.

### DESCRIPTION:
<P align="justify">Millions of individuals suffer from upper extremity paralysis caused by neurological disorders including stroke, traumatic brain injury, or spinal cord injury. Robotic hand exoskeletons can substitute the missing motor control and help restore the functions in daily operations. However, most of the hand exoskeletons are bulky, stationary, and cumbersome to use. Using 3D printing technology, we have developed a motorized, lightweight, fully wearable rehabilitative hand exoskeleton capable of producing various grasps needed for the execution of daily tasks. The exoskeleton can produce fingertip force up to 8 N and can cover 91.5Â° of range of motion in just 3 s ans weights just 228 g. We tested the exoskeleton on two individuals with severe dextarity impairments. The results strongly support the functionality restoration
and usability of the exokeleton in performing daily activities. Total components cost prototype one exoskeleton is around $150!</P>

### DISCLAIMER:
<P align="justify"> The design is offered as it is. Although it has been regorously tested with utmost care and to the best of our knowledge, we do not provide any warranty in any aspect.</P>

### WARNING:
- The device is intended stricktly for research and education purposes.
- The exoskeleton is not certified for use without receving prior approval from a local safety board or review committee.
